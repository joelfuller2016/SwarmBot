## Summary
- **Total Files Identified**: 10
- **Successfully Moved**: 8
- **Failed to Move**: 2 (due to files being in use)

## Next Steps
1. Stop any running SwarmBot processes
2. Manually move the remaining files:
   - Move `swarmbot_chats.db` to `data/`
   - Move `swarmbot_enhanced.log` to `logs/`
3. Consider adding these files to .gitignore if not already present

## Project Structure After Cleanup
The root directory is now cleaner with test files properly organized in the tests/ directory and documentation in the appropriate Docs/ subdirectories.
