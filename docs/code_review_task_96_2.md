   - ✅ core/cost_tracker.py - Cost tracking logic
   - ✅ core/integrated_analyzer.py - Token analyzer integration
   - ✅ core/cost_updater.py - Automated price updates

3. **Testing**
   - ✅ tests/test_cost_tracking_schema.py - Comprehensive test suite
   - ✅ tests/test_cost_tracking.py - Integration tests

## Technical Review

### Schema Design ✅
- **Strengths**:
  - Well-normalized structure balancing integrity and performance
  - Appropriate use of composite primary keys
  - Comprehensive indexing strategy
  - CHECK constraints for data validation
  
- **Best Practices Followed**:
  - ACID compliance with proper transaction handling
  - Decimal precision for financial calculations
  - Temporal tracking for historical analysis

### Performance Optimizations ✅
- **Implemented**:
  - Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode
  - Strategic indexing on all foreign keys and query fields
  - Automatic aggregation via triggers
  - Query performance monitoring
  - In-memory caching with LRU eviction

- **SQLite-Specific**:
  - Proper PRAGMA settings
  - Cache size optimization (10MB)
  - Synchronous mode balanced for performance

### Code Quality ✅
- **Strengths**:
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Well-documented functions
  - Type hints throughout
  - Logging at appropriate levels

- **Testing**:
  - Unit tests for all major components
  - Integration tests for end-to-end flows
  - Health check validation
  - Export functionality verification

### Security Considerations ✅
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- Input validation with CHECK constraints
- Proper error message sanitization
- No sensitive data in logs

## Recommendations

### Minor Improvements (Non-blocking)
1. **Connection Pooling**: Consider implementing connection pooling for high-concurrency scenarios
2. **Batch Operations**: Add explicit batch insert methods for bulk operations
3. **Data Retention**: Implement automated archival policies for old data
4. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Create visual monitoring for slow queries

### Future Enhancements
1. Multi-currency support for international deployments
2. Advanced caching strategies (Redis integration)
3. Real-time streaming analytics
4. GraphQL API for flexible querying

## Compliance Check

### Task Requirements ✅
- [x] model_costs table with all required fields
- [x] request_costs table with proper foreign keys
- [x] conversation_costs aggregation table
- [x] Migration scripts with rollback capability
- [x] Integration with existing DatabaseLogger
- [x] Performance optimizations
- [x] Comprehensive testing

### Best Practices from Research ✅
- [x] Balanced schema design (normalized with strategic denormalization)
- [x] High-volume logging optimizations
- [x] Data accuracy mechanisms
- [x] SQLite-specific optimizations
- [x] Proper error handling and recovery

## Test Results
All tests pass successfully:
- Database creation and migrations ✅
- Cost calculation accuracy ✅
- Health check functionality ✅
- Export operations ✅
- Performance within acceptable limits ✅

## Conclusion
The implementation is **production-ready** and exceeds the requirements. The code follows best practices, includes comprehensive testing, and provides a solid foundation for the cost tracking system.

**Recommendation**: ✅ **APPROVE and MERGE**

## Sign-off
- Code Review: Complete
- Testing: Pass
- Documentation: Complete
- Security: Verified
- Performance: Optimized
