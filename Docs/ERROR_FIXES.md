# SwarmBot Error Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Event Loop Cleanup Errors
**Problem**: Multiple "RuntimeError: Event loop is closed" exceptions when exiting SwarmBot.

**Solution**:
- Added proper event loop management for Windows
- Implemented graceful shutdown with timeout handling
- Added cleanup delays to allow subprocess termination
- Suppressed ResourceWarning messages that are harmless

### 2. Unicode/UTF-8 Encoding Issues
**Problem**: "I/O operation on closed file" error due to stdout/stderr redirection.

**Solution**:
- Removed problematic stdout/stderr wrapper approach
- Set console code page to UTF-8 using Windows commands
- Added proper encoding environment variables

## How to Run SwarmBot

### Method 1: Using the Runner Script (Recommended)
```bash
# For standard SwarmBot
python run_swarmbot.py

# For enhanced SwarmBot with automatic tools
python run_swarmbot.py enhanced
```

### Method 2: Using Batch Files
```bash
# Standard version
start_swarmbot.bat

# Enhanced version
swarmbot_enhanced.bat
```

### Method 3: Direct Python Execution
```bash
# Standard version
python main.py

# Enhanced version  
python enhanced_main.py
```

## Testing the Fixes

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
python test_fixes.py
```

## What Changed

1. **Asyncio Event Loop Management**
   - Custom event loop creation and cleanup
   - Windows-specific ProactorEventLoop policy
   - Proper task cancellation and gathering

2. **Server Cleanup**
   - Added timeout protection (5 seconds)
   - Check for active sessions before cleanup
   - Added delays for process termination

3. **Console Encoding**
   - Windows console set to UTF-8 (code page 65001)
   - Environment variables for Python encoding
   - Removed problematic stdout wrappers

4. **Error Suppression**
   - Suppressed harmless ResourceWarning messages
   - Better exception handling during shutdown

## Environment Variables

The following are automatically set:
- `PYTHONWARNINGS=ignore::ResourceWarning`
- `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`

## Troubleshooting

If you still see errors:

1. **Update Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.8+ 
2. **Check MCP Package**: Update with `pip install --upgrade mcp`
3. **Virtual Environment**: Use a clean virtual environment
4. **Run Test Script**: Use `test_fixes.py` to diagnose issues

## Technical Details

The main issues were:
- Windows subprocess handles not closing properly before event loop shutdown
- UTF-8 console encoding conflicts with stdout wrappers
- Asyncio cleanup race conditions

The fixes ensure:
- Proper subprocess cleanup before loop closure
- Native Windows console UTF-8 support
- Graceful shutdown with timeouts
- Better compatibility with Python 3.13+
