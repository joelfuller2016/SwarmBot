# SwarmBot Project Cleanup Summary
Date: June 9, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive cleanup and reorganization of the SwarmBot project structure.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Documentation Organization
Created a proper directory structure under `Docs/`:
- **`Docs/fixes/`** - Contains 18 fix-related documentation files
- **`Docs/guides/`** - Contains 12 user guides and how-to documents  
- **`Docs/technical/`** - Contains 15 technical documentation files
- **`Docs/reports/`** - Contains 51 status reports and analysis documents
- **`Docs/archive/`** - Preserved for historical documentation

**Total files organized**: 96 documentation files

### 2. File Relocations
- Moved `CIRCULAR_IMPORT_FIX.md` from root to `Docs/fixes/`
- Moved `HOW_TO_TEST_SWARMBOT.md` from root to `Docs/guides/`
- Moved `fix_circular_import.py` from root to `scripts/`
- Moved `CHANGELOG.md` from `Docs/` to root directory (standard location)
- Moved `mcp_organization_log.md` from root to `Docs/reports/`

### 3. Scripts Created
- **`scripts/move_docs.py`** - Automated documentation organization script
- **`scripts/clean_logs.py`** - Log file management utility

### 4. Configuration Updates
- Updated `.gitignore` to include `.pytest_cache/`
- Preserved all configuration files in their current locations

### 5. Directory Structure Preserved
- Maintained existing source code structure (`src/`)
- Kept test structure intact (`tests/`)
- Preserved taskmaster configuration (`.taskmaster/`)
- Maintained data directory structure (`data/`)

## Current Project Status

### Taskmaster Statistics
- **Total Tasks**: 96
- **Completed**: 43 (44.79%)
- **In Progress**: 1
- **Pending**: 49
- **Cancelled**: 3

### High Priority Pending Tasks
1. Task 14: Enhanced Mode with Auto-Tools Implementation
2. Task 15: MCP Server Connection Management
3. Task 37: Implement Chat Message Pipeline
4. Task 38: Fix Enhanced Mode Routing
5. Task 39: Create MCP Server Health Check System

```

## Recommendations

1. **Consolidate Launchers**: Consider implementing Task 53 to consolidate multiple launcher scripts
2. **Clean Logs Regularly**: Use `scripts/clean_logs.py` to manage log files
3. **Update Documentation**: Keep documentation in the new organized structure
4. **Complete High Priority Tasks**: Focus on the pending high-priority tasks for enhanced functionality

## Next Steps

1. Test all functionality to ensure nothing broke during reorganization
2. Update any hardcoded paths in the codebase if necessary
3. Commit these changes to version control with appropriate message
4. Continue with high-priority task implementation

## Files Remaining in Docs Root
- `.roomodes` - Editor configuration
- `.windsurfrules` - Editor configuration  
- `env_auto_prompt_additions.txt` - Configuration reference
- `SwarmBot Arc.pdf` - Architecture diagram

These files are intentionally left in place as they serve specific purposes.
