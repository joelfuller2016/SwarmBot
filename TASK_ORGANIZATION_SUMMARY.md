# SwarmBot Task Organization Summary

## Updated Task Structure

I've updated the taskmaster to include critical setup tasks (IDs 26-30) that need to be completed BEFORE the enhancement tasks. Here's the new priority order:

### ðŸ”´ PHASE 0: Project Setup (Tasks 26-30) - START HERE
1. **Task 26**: Setup Environment Configuration File (.env)
2. **Task 27**: Install and Verify Python Dependencies  
3. **Task 28**: Test Core SwarmBot Launcher (depends on 26, 27)
4. **Task 29**: Create Modular Function Library for Swarm Access
5. **Task 30**: Test and Validate MCP Server Connections (depends on 26, 27)

### ðŸŸ¡ PHASE 1: Core Enhancements (Tasks 1-25)
- SQLite persistence (Tasks 1-2)
- Code consolidation (Task 3)
- Testing framework (Task 4)
- EditorWindowGUI integration (Tasks 7-11)
- Security features (Tasks 24-25)
- And more...

## Critical Development Principles

### ðŸŽ¯ MODULARITY
- All functions must be designed as modular components
- Every method should be accessible by swarm agents
- Use the function registry (Task 29) for shared utilities
- Design for concurrent multi-agent access

### ðŸ’¾ PERSISTENCE  
- **ALWAYS update project state and memory after EVERY response**
- Use taskmaster to track all progress
- Document changes in the knowledge graph
- Keep the conversation context updated

### ðŸ”„ Workflow Reminders
1. Start with setup tasks (26-30) to get the system running
2. Test each component with multiple agents
3. Document all shared functions in the modular library
4. Update memory and project state after each session
5. Use `next-task` command to work systematically

## Next Steps

```bash
# View the next task to work on
taskmaster next-task

# Start with environment setup (Task 26)
taskmaster get-task --id 26

# Mark task as in progress
taskmaster set-task-status --id 26 --status in-progress

# After completing, mark as done
taskmaster set-task-status --id 26 --status done
```

## Important Notes

1. **EditorWindowGUI Integration**: This component can significantly enhance the developer experience. It's currently unused but offers:
   - Multi-language script editing
   - MCP tool integration
   - Visual debugging interface

2. **Modular Function Library** (Task 29): This is CRITICAL for the swarm to function properly. All agents need access to shared utilities.

3. **Testing**: Always test changes with multiple agents to ensure compatibility.

Remember: **Update project state and memory after EVERY development response!**
