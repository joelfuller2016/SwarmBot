Product Requirements Document: LLM API Cost Tracking System

1. Executive Summary
The LLM API Cost Tracking System is a critical component for SwarmBot that provides real-time monitoring and reporting of API usage costs across multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq). This system will enable users to track expenses, set budgets, and optimize their LLM usage for cost efficiency.

2. Problem Statement
- Currently no visibility into LLM API costs during usage
- No budget controls or alerts for excessive spending
- No ability to compare costs across different models/providers
- Missing integration between token counting and cost calculation

3. Goals and Objectives
- Track costs for each API request in real-time
- Support multiple LLM providers with different pricing models
- Integrate seamlessly with existing SwarmBot infrastructure
- Provide budget monitoring and alerting capabilities
- Generate detailed cost reports and analytics
- Maintain minimal performance impact (<5% latency increase)

4. Functional Requirements

4.1 Critical Bug Fixes
- Fix session ID not being passed from chat_session to LLM client
- Fix migration system failure on first run
- Standardize naming convention (session_id vs conversation_id)
- Add missing foreign key constraints
- Handle missing query performance log table

4.2 Core Cost Tracking
- Calculate costs based on token usage and model pricing
- Store cost data in SQLite database with proper schema
- Support custom pricing configurations
- Track costs at request, conversation, and aggregate levels

4.3 System Integration
- Integrate with existing chat session management
- Connect to LLM client adapters
- Maintain conversation context for cost aggregation
- Support multiple concurrent sessions

4.4 Reporting and Analytics
- Generate cost summaries by session, day, month
- Export data in JSON and CSV formats
- Provide model comparison analytics
- Show cost optimization recommendations

4.5 Budget Management
- Set monthly/daily spending limits
- Real-time budget monitoring
- Configurable alert thresholds
- Automatic notifications when limits approached

4.6 User Interface
- Dashboard showing current costs
- Historical cost trends visualization
- Model cost comparison charts
- Budget status indicators

5. Technical Requirements
- Use SQLite with WAL mode for performance
- Implement LRU caching for model pricing
- Support decimal precision for financial accuracy
- Database migrations for schema updates
- Configuration via environment variables

6. Performance Requirements
- Maximum 5% latency increase on API calls
- Support 1000+ concurrent sessions
- Database queries under 10ms
- Memory usage under 100MB

7. Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all cost calculations
- Integration tests for end-to-end flow
- Performance benchmarking
- Data accuracy validation
- Migration testing

8. Documentation Requirements
- API reference documentation
- Configuration guide
- User manual
- Migration instructions
- Troubleshooting guide

9. Timeline
- Phase 1 (Days 1-2): Critical bug fixes
- Phase 2 (Days 3-4): Testing and documentation
- Phase 3 (Days 5-7): UI development
- Phase 4 (Days 8-10): Advanced features
- Phase 5 (Days 11-12): Production readiness

10. Success Criteria
- Accurate cost tracking for all API calls
- System works on fresh installation
- All configurations documented
- Export functionality operational
- Budget alerts working correctly
- Performance within requirements
- All tests passing
- Complete user documentation
