# SwarmBot: Dynamic AI Swarm Orchestrator
## Product Requirements Document

### Executive Summary
SwarmBot is an ambitious AI system that begins as a simple MCP-enabled chatbot and self-evolves into a sophisticated Dynamic AI Swarm Orchestrator over a 35-day evolution cycle. The system leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized tool integration, implements multi-agent orchestration patterns, and uses chain-of-thought reasoning to bootstrap its own capabilities progressively.

### Vision Statement
Create a self-improving AI system that can autonomously evolve from a basic conversational interface into a fully-featured swarm orchestrator capable of managing multiple specialized AI agents working in parallel on complex, distributed tasks.

### Core Objectives
1. **Self-Evolution**: Implement an AI system that can analyze its own capabilities, identify gaps, and build new features autonomously
2. **MCP Integration**: Leverage Model Context Protocol as the foundation for tool and data source connectivity
3. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Develop a swarm architecture where specialized agents collaborate efficiently
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build capabilities incrementally through a structured 35-day evolution process
5. **Context Preservation**: Maintain knowledge and context across sessions and agent interactions
