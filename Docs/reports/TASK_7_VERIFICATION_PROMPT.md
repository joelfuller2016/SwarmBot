# Verification Prompt for Task 7: MCP Server Installation and Testing

## Task Overview
Task 7 required implementing a system to install and test MCP (Model Context Protocol) server components for the SwarmBot system. This is a critical dependency that blocks 15+ other tasks.

## Please Verify the Following Implementation:

### 1. Core Components (Check these files exist and are functional):
- [ ] `src/mcp/server_inventory.py` - Can scan servers from config and check prerequisites
- [ ] `src/mcp/prerequisite_installer.py` - Provides installation guidance for missing dependencies
- [ ] `src/mcp/install_manager.py` - Manages server installation process
- [ ] `src/mcp/server_manager.py` - Handles server lifecycle (start/stop/restart)
- [ ] `src/mcp/__init__.py` - Properly exports all classes

### 2. Configuration:
- [ ] `config/servers_config.json` exists with 7 configured MCP servers
- [ ] Servers include: filesystem, memory, sequential-thinking, github, sqlite-db, code-reasoning, brave-search
- [ ] Each server has proper type, command, args, and optional health_check configuration

### 3. Test Scripts:
- [ ] `tests/mcp/test_mcp_management.py` - Tests full system integration
- [ ] `tests/mcp/test_inventory.py` - Tests inventory scanning
- [ ] `tests/mcp/test_mcp_setup.py` - Quick configuration verification
- [ ] `scripts/check_mcp_servers.bat` - Windows batch script for quick checks
- [ ] `scripts/test_mcp_system.bat` - Full system test script

### 4. Documentation:
- [ ] `docs/mcp_server_management.md` - User guide with usage instructions
- [ ] `docs/TASK_7_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed implementation notes
- [ ] `examples/mcp_integration_example.py` - Shows how to integrate with SwarmBot

### 5. Functionality Tests:
Run these commands and verify they work:

```bash
# Test 1: Check server configuration
python src/mcp/install_mcp_servers.py --verify

# Expected output: Should list 7 servers and check prerequisites

# Test 2: Test inventory scanning
python tests/mcp/test_inventory.py

# Expected output: Should scan and display all 7 configured servers

# Test 3: Run full management test
python tests/mcp/test_mcp_management.py

# Expected output: Should test inventory, prerequisites, installation, and server manager
```

### 6. Key Features to Verify:
- [ ] Server inventory can detect Node.js vs Python servers
- [ ] Prerequisites checker validates Node.js 16+, Python 3.8+, and UV
- [ ] Environment variables with ${VAR} syntax are properly resolved
- [ ] Server manager can start/stop processes using asyncio
- [ ] Installation manager marks npx/uvx servers as "ready" (no local install needed)

### 7. Integration Readiness:
- [ ] The system is modular and can be imported: `from src.mcp import MCPServerInventory, MCPServerManager`
- [ ] Example integration code exists in `examples/mcp_integration_example.py`
- [ ] No hardcoded paths - uses relative paths from project root

## Success Criteria:
✅ All core components are implemented and documented
✅ Test scripts run without errors
✅ System can discover, validate, and manage MCP servers
✅ Code is modular and ready for integration with main SwarmBot app
✅ Documentation is comprehensive and includes examples

## Notes for Verifier:
- This implementation focuses on the foundation - actual server communication/health checks are for future tasks
- The system uses asyncio for all server management operations
- npx and uvx servers don't require local installation (run directly)
- All paths are configured relative to the SwarmBot project root

Please run the test scripts and confirm all components are working as described above.
