SwarmBot Complete Project Implementation - Product Requirements Document

PROJECT OVERVIEW
SwarmBot is a sophisticated multi-agent AI system that orchestrates collaborative AI operations through specialized agents, dynamic task distribution, and comprehensive real-time monitoring. This document covers both initial setup and enhancement phases.

CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES
- MODULARITY: All methods and functions must be designed as modular components that can be accessed by the swarm agents
- PERSISTENCE: Always update project state and memory after every development response
- INTEGRATION: Ensure all components can communicate seamlessly with the agent system
- SCALABILITY: Design for distributed execution and multi-agent access
