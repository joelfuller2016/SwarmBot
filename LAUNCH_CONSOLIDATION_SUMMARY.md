# SwarmBot Launch System Consolidation Summary

## Changes Made (June 8, 2025)

### 1. Created Unified Launcher
- **File**: `launch.py` (v3.0)
- **Features**:
  - Automatic dependency checking and installation
  - Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
  - Interactive menu with 8 options
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - UTF-8 encoding support
  - Color-coded output
  - Reads all dependencies from requirements.txt
  - Creates .env file if missing
  - Validates API keys
  - Includes UI component checking
  - Full diagnostics support

### 2. Created Simple Platform Launchers
- **launch.bat**: Windows batch file that calls launch.py
- **launch.sh**: Unix/Linux/macOS shell script that calls launch.py

### 3. Deprecated Old Launchers
Moved to `deprecated_launchers/` folder:
- `launch_dashboard.py` (replaced by menu option 1)
- `fix_and_launch_ui.bat` (functionality integrated into launch.py)
- `swarmbot.bat` (replaced by launch.bat)

### 4. Kept Essential Files
- `swarmbot.py`: Core application (unchanged)
- `swarmbot.ps1`: PowerShell integration (unchanged)
- `swarmbot.sh`: Shell script integration (unchanged)

### 5. Updated Documentation
- **README.MD**: Completely updated with:
  - Simplified quick start
  - Clear launch instructions
  - Updated project structure
  - Better troubleshooting guide
  - Emphasis on using launch.py

## Benefits

1. **Single Entry Point**: Users only need to run `launch.py`
2. **Automatic Setup**: Dependencies installed automatically
3. **Better UX**: Interactive menu instead of command-line arguments
4. **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive checks and diagnostics
5. **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
6. **Maintainability**: One file to maintain instead of multiple

## Usage

```bash
# Recommended way to start SwarmBot
python launch.py

# Alternative for specific platforms
./launch.bat    # Windows
./launch.sh     # Linux/macOS
```

## Migration Notes

- All functionality from deprecated launchers is preserved
- No breaking changes for existing users
- Command-line arguments still work via swarmbot.py
- Configuration files remain unchanged
