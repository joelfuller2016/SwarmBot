SwarmBot Enhancement Project - Product Requirements Document

PROJECT OVERVIEW
SwarmBot is a sophisticated multi-agent AI system that orchestrates collaborative AI operations through specialized agents, dynamic task distribution, and comprehensive real-time monitoring. This enhancement project aims to improve the system's capabilities, integrate unused components, and implement critical missing features.

OBJECTIVES
1. Integrate the existing EditorWindowGUI.py component into the SwarmBot ecosystem
2. Implement persistent storage for agent metrics and task history
3. Add agent learning and improvement mechanisms
4. Complete code consolidation and remove duplicates
5. Enhance testing coverage and documentation
6. Implement advanced agent collaboration patterns

   - Integration tests for all agent types
   - Performance benchmarks for critical paths
   - Automated regression testing

USER STORIES

1. As a developer, I want to use the EditorWindowGUI to create and test agent scripts visually
2. As a system administrator, I want to see historical agent performance to optimize the swarm
3. As a power user, I want agents to learn from past executions and improve over time
4. As a researcher, I want to visualize agent decision-making processes
5. As a team lead, I want to create custom agents for our specific workflows

SUCCESS METRICS
