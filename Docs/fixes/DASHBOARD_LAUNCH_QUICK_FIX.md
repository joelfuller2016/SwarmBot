# SwarmBot Dashboard Launch - Quick Fix

## Latest Error Fixed
The dashboard was trying to use the deprecated `app.run_server()` method. 

### Fix Applied âœ…
Changed line 176 in `src\ui\dash\app.py`:
```python
# OLD (deprecated):
app.run_server(host=host, port=port, debug=debug, threaded=True)

# NEW (fixed):
app.run(host=host, port=port, debug=debug, threaded=True)
```

## Try Launching Again
Now that all fixes have been applied, try launching the dashboard:

```bash
python swarmbot.py --ui
```

## Expected Output
You should see something like:
```
============================================================
                    [SwarmBot]
          AI Assistant with MCP Tools
============================================================
