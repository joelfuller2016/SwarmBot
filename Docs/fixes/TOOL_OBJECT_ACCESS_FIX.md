# Tool Object Access Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
When users selected option 5 (List Available Tools) in SwarmBot, they encountered the error:
```
[filesystem]: Failed to initialize - 'Tool' object is not subscriptable
```

This occurred because the code was trying to access Tool objects as if they were dictionaries, using bracket notation like `tool['name']` instead of object attribute notation like `tool.name`.

## Root Cause Analysis
The error occurred in `src/core/app.py` at line 227 in the `list_tools` method:
```python
# Incorrect code:
print(f"  - {tool['name']}: {tool.get('description', 'No description')}")
```

The Tool class (defined in `src/tool.py`) is a proper Python class with attributes:
- `self.name` (str)
- `self.description` (str)
- `self.input_schema` (dict)

These are object attributes, not dictionary keys, so they must be accessed using dot notation.

## Solution Implemented
Changed the dictionary access to object attribute access:
```python
# Fixed code:
print(f"  - {tool.name}: {tool.description}")
```

## Testing
Created `tests/test_tool_object_fix.py` to verify:
1. The list_tools functionality runs without errors
2. Tools are properly displayed with their names and descriptions
3. No "'Tool' object is not subscriptable" errors occur

## Impact
- Fixes the immediate error preventing tool listing
- No breaking changes - the Tool class interface remains the same
- Other parts of the code that correctly use Tool objects are unaffected

## Verification Steps
To verify the fix:
1. Run `python launch.py` and select option 5 (List Available Tools)
2. Should see the list of tools without any "not subscriptable" errors
3. Test with `python swarmbot.py --list-tools` command
4. Run `python tests/test_tool_object_fix.py` to execute automated test

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Use type hints to clearly indicate when methods return Tool objects vs dictionaries
2. Ensure consistent usage of Tool objects throughout the codebase
3. Add unit tests for Tool class usage
