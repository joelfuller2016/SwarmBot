### Impact on SwarmBot

The WebSocket implementation transforms SwarmBot from a traditional polling-based system to a modern, real-time collaborative platform. Users now experience:

- Instant feedback on agent actions
- Live task progress updates
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Seamless multi-user collaboration

### Technical Debt Addressed

- Eliminated inefficient polling loops
- Reduced server resource consumption
- Improved scalability for multi-user scenarios
- Modernized communication architecture

### Conclusion

With today's test suite fixes, the WebSocket implementation is technically complete and ready for production. Only documentation tasks remain before full deployment. The implementation successfully achieves all design goals while maintaining backward compatibility and system stability.

The SwarmBot dashboard now provides a truly real-time experience that scales efficiently and responds instantly to system changes, marking a major advancement in the platform's capabilities.
